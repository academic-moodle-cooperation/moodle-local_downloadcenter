Description
-----------

The Download Center plugin enables all users to download all files, folders as well as all documents
of student folders of the entire course as a ZIP archive with a clear folder structure.


Example
-------

With this module participants of a course can download all relevant course documents (files, folders, assignments,
books, pages, Lightbox galleries, and documents from student folders) in one step. Therefore users can save valuable time
compared to single-downloads of files. One use-case of the download center is to download of all files
before a flight, so all course files can be accessed offline.


Requirements
------------

The plugin is available for Moodle 3.1+. This version is for Moodle 3.10


Installation
------------

* Copy the code directly to the local/downloadcenter directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation
  automatically.


Admin Settings
--------------
* Exclude empty topics - empty topics (without any downloadable files) should be present in the zip archive. 

Privacy API
-----------

The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-local_downloadcenter/issues). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
