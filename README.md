Description
-----------

The Download Center enables teachers and students to download the content of selected activities and materials from a course as a ZIP archive.


Usage
-------

Teachers make documents available in a Moodle course during the semester. In addition, various activities and materials are used to make the course more active. 
At any time during or at the end of the course, students can easily save published content locally for personal use and use it for example offline to prepare for an exam.Â 
Teachers can download and archive this content in the same way, with hidden content also available for selection by the teacher. In addition, all submissions of an assignment can also be downloaded in a compact form including feedback.

Note: Currently, the course contents assignment, book, file, glossary, page, folder, ligthbox gallery, Etherpad Lite and student folder are available for selection in the Download Center. Furthermore, Download Center supports Moodle subsections and keeps the structure of sections and subsections when downloading.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
